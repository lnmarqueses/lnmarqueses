👋 Hi, my name is @lnmarqueses and I want to be a web developer. I started my journey on November 2021. 
👀I am a medical professional by day and I love playing the piano, hiking and running.

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Java.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects. I amd looking for a mentor to teach me more advance stuff and how the industry works. 
    Or we can talk about anything under the sun, really.
📫 Send me hi!
